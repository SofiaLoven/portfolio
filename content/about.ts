  "I'm a registered nurse that decided to become a Frontend developer. I have worked in multiple time consuming programs as a nurse and I know that it is possible to do them better and more user friendly. My goal is to make work easier for the people using my product. I want them to se it as a helping tool.",

  "I'm down to earth, social and curious. On my free time I am often in my kitchen. Baking some bread or trying on a new recipe. I find my peace and calm in the forest and my favorite hobby in the autumn is mushroom picking.",

  "Does it find interesting? Reach out, I'm always happy to grab a coffee! (And I know some great places in Stockholm)",
